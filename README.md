# chatbot
Overview: 
A topical chatbot is a specialized AI designed for conversations about a specific subject. Unlike general chatbots, these focus on one topic, like medicine or finance. They're trained to understand and discuss that area, using datasets of relevant conversations. Topical chatbots provide accurate and helpful information within their domain, enhancing user engagement and knowledge in that subject. However, they may struggle with topics beyond their training and lack broader conversational abilities.
