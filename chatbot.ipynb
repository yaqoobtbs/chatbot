        "The chatbot code presented utilizes a state-of-the-art Transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, a cutting-edge deep learning model that excels in conversational AI applications. This architecture leverages advanced self-attention mechanisms to process and generate contextually relevant responses, ensuring a more natural and coherent conversation flow. However, it's worth noting that the provided code doesn't directly implement the Transformer-based model but instead relies on simpler techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity for generating responses. Transitioning to a full-fledged Transformer-based chatbot would necessitate substantial modifications and extensive training with a comprehensive conversational dataset, representing a significant advancement in chatbot sophistication and performance.\n"
